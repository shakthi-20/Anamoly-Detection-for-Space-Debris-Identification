# Anamoly-Detection-for-Space-Debris-Identification

This project focuses on the classification of space objects and the detection of space debris using deep learning methodologies. Our approach leverages autoencoders and other machine learning techniques to analyze and categorize space objects based on satellite imagery, incorporating both optical and infrared datasets.

## Repository Structure

- **JWSTtesting.py** - Script for testing the model using images from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST).
- **autoencoder.py** - Implementation of an autoencoder model for anomaly detection and feature extraction.
- **autoencoder_model.pth** - Trained model weights for the autoencoder.
- **evaluation.py** - Script for evaluating model performance, generating key metrics, and analyzing classification accuracy.
- **preprocessing.py** - Dataset preprocessing pipeline, including cleaning, augmentation, and transformation.
- **rgb.py** - Converts and enhances infrared FITS images into RGB format for better visualization.
- **testdata.py** - Configuration and utilities for handling the test dataset.
- **testingcode.py** - Testing scripts for validating the model using data generated by testdata.py.

## Methodology

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- The original dataset, downloaded from Kaggle, contained **8 subclasses**.
- The dataset was preprocessed using `preprocessing.py`, cleaning the data and structuring it for model training.
- The processed dataset was stored in `d_data_filtered/`, derived from the original `dldata/` directory.
- For evaluation purposes, 20% of the processed dataset was extracted and stored as the test dataset.

### 2. Model Training
- The **autoencoder model** implemented in `autoencoder.py` was trained using optical images from the Kaggle dataset.
- Training was conducted on preprocessed and structured data, focusing on space object classification and debris anomaly detection.

### 3. Testing and Evaluation
- `testingcode.py` was used to validate the trained model using the Kaggle dataset.
- Additional testing was conducted using **infrared images** obtained from satellite archives.
  - Images were sourced from publicly available **James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) archives** in ** FITS format**.
  - **FITS Liberator** was used to process these images, applying **Asinh scaling** to enhance visualization.
  - The processed images were converted to **TIFF format**.
  - The **`rgb.py` script** converted the TIFF files into RGB images for further analysis.
  - `JWSTtesting.py` was used to test the model on five JWST infrared images.
- `evaluation.py` was used to assess model performance, primarily focusing on the Kaggle dataset test set, ensuring accuracy and reliability.
